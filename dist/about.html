        <h3 class="text-secondary">Intro</h3>
        <p>The department offers a Major in Materials Engineering leading to an accredited B.Eng. degree in Materials Engineering. Materials are used to enact every human technology and have shaped key eras in history. Major in Materials Engineering students will have the opportunity to learn the fundamental science and engineering of materials through the materials processing pipeline, including how to enrich mineral-poor ore, how to process the materials into the desired microstructures and compositions, and how to use these materials in various applications (aerospace, electronics, and biological systems). With the choice of technical complementary courses, students have an opportunity to specialize and strengthen key materials technologies or broaden their horizons and take courses from several interdisciplinary areas.</p>

        <p>Accreditation  units  (AU's)  are  defined  on  an  hourly  basis  for  an  activity  which  is  granted  academic  credit  and  for  which  the  associated  number of hours corresponds to the actual contact time: one hour of lecture (corresponding to 50 minutes of activity) = 1 AU; one hour of laboratory or scheduled tutorial = 0.5 AU. Classes of other than the nominal 50-minute duration are treated proportionally. In assessing the time assigned to determine the AU's of various components of the curriculum, the actual instruction time exclusive of final examinations is used. </p>
